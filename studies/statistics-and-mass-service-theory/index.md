Stepwise and ridge regression. Queueing models. Kendall's classification. Key stochastic characteristics of queueing models. Little’s formulas. PASTA property. M/M/1 queueing model with unlimited and limited buffer capacity. Multichannel M/M/c service model. Priority service. M/G/1 queueing model. Pollaczek–Khinchine formulas. Queueing models with limited access to the service station. Service station warm-up period. Threshold discipline. "Insensitive" queueing models.  

### Learning outcomes:
knows and understands:  
E1: the process of statistical inference and selected nonparametric and parametric tests;  
E2: the concept of multiple regression;  
E3: the basics of queueing theory, including selected queueing models and their key characteristics.  

Skills: is able to:  
E4: carry out the process of statistical inference in practice using selected statistical tests;  
E5: use the multiple regression tool  
and assess the degree of fit of the adopted regression model to empirical data;  
E6: apply selected queueing systems  
and their stochastic characteristics
in practical modeling.
